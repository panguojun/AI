# Energy Landscape Exploration for Path Planning

## Overview
This project implements an innovative energy landscape-based approach for optimal path planning in constrained environments. The method combines Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with energy minimization principles to explore the configuration space of possible paths while satisfying multiple constraints.

## Key Features
- **Energy-based modeling**: Transforms path planning into an energy minimization problem
- **Multi-constraint handling**: Simultaneously considers obstacles, danger zones, affinity regions, and path smoothness
- **Target-guaranteed sampling**: Ensures all generated paths reach the specified target point
- **Visual analytics**: Provides intuitive visualization of the path energy landscape

## Universal Value Proposition

### 1. Generalizable Framework
The energy landscape approach provides a universal framework for constrained optimization problems that can be adapted to:
- Robotics path planning
- Protein folding simulations
- Molecular conformation analysis
- Network routing optimization
- Any problem with quantifiable constraints and objectives

### 2. Constraint Integration
The method elegantly handles multiple constraint types through energy terms:
- **Hard constraints** (e.g., obstacles) via high-energy penalties
- **Soft constraints** (e.g., preferred zones) through moderate energy adjustments
- **Global objectives** (e.g., target reaching) with guided sampling

### 3. Efficient Exploration
The hybrid MCMC sampling offers:
- **Global exploration**: Broad coverage of configuration space
- **Local refinement**: Fine-tuning of promising solutions
- **Adaptive balancing**: Automatic adjustment between exploration/exploitation via temperature scheduling

### 4. Visual Decision Support
The energy landscape visualization provides:
- Intuitive understanding of solution quality distribution
- Identification of distinct solution clusters
- Insight into constraint satisfaction trade-offs

## Technical Implementation
The algorithm:
1. Encodes paths as directional sequences
2. Defines an energy function incorporating:
   - Constraint violations
   - Path properties (length, smoothness)
   - Target proximity
3. Samples the configuration space using MCMC with:
   - Target-oriented proposal generation
   - Adaptive temperature scheduling
   - Energy-based acceptance criteria

## Applications
This approach is particularly valuable for:
- Autonomous vehicle navigation
- Industrial pipe/route planning
- Biological path finding (e.g., neuron growth)
- Any scenario requiring constraint-satisfying paths in complex environments
